You know what the word is about sequels? The one that they are worse than the first in the series. Well, we know what the verdict on Yamla Pagla Deewana was. All we can say is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 stays true to the genre, "sequels".

Okay maybe, the plot is a little more coherent that that of Yamla Pagla Deewana. But, that comparison is pretty much pointless considering Yamla Pagla Deewana didn't have a plot at all. 
The performances are the same brand of loud and over-the-top, good enough to once again make the actors look like fools prancing around. Once again, heart goes out for Anupam Kher and this time even Annu Kapoor who are reduced to doing such roles. Interestingly, Sunny Deol is the one who gives it his all and tries to pull the film along.
As far as the action and comedy go, I have no clue who the action would excite and who would laugh at the jokes or get excited. There is always that element of laughing at, "so silly that you cannot but laugh" in films of this type. Fortunately or unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 has that element, but it wanes in about two and a half minutes. 
While watching the film, the only thing I was cringing at was the thought that there might be a Yamla Pagla Deewana 3. There is a Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, right? What is going to stop a third one from coming along? shudder
