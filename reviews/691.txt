Shakal Pe Mat Ja comes across as a vehicle for one particular person to exhibit everything he has. As if that is not bad enough, each talent that this particular person is show-casing is not worth even commenting on, let alone making a film out of. Shubh Mukherjee has written, directed and is the lead actor.

The angles chosen, especially in the beginning of the film, are stylish but are a complete misfit for a comedy that is about four friends who are suspected as terrorists and there are real terrorists lurking around. This one-line description is all you know for most of the first half. Nothing new happens except the same characters repeat the same questions and stories and fart jokes. Actually, the toilet humor is some of the worst - yes, even worse than Delhi Belly. Do people really laugh at urine being sprayed around? Disgusting.
For all you know this might be the writer/director's tribute/reference to the film. Because there are enough number of those strewn through the film - each one of them contrived, painful and out-of-place. In fact, the writing is abysmal for a comedy. There might be a spot or two that make you smile because the silliness is getting too out-of-hand. 
The actors are all loud without exception - even after you've accepted that the genre supposedly demands raw noise. 
Shakal Pe Mat Ja is a tiring experience at twenty minutes over two hours. It is one of those films that you don't know where to start your complains
