Routine problems, marital tiffs are resolved magically using random mantraaa,
and long discourses delivered by a neighbor, a colleague or a rickshaw-walaaa.
Brainless chicks and men who have crassness for wit deliver without a commaaa,
lines that seem like they have been written by a spot boy with the production-fellaaa.
Screaming - the only way they were taught to act at the school of overacting and melodramaaa,
Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa.
Middle-of-frame objects, close-ups - surely there are other ways to use the cameraaa.
And, where's the rhythm, where's the flow? If it's not in the lyrics or the orchestraaa,
can we blame the editor, when its not on his agendaaa?
The maker is by far no Hrishikesh Mukherjee and the reviewer is only meetaaa,
so just like the movie, 2 extra "aa"s aren't going to make this review any bettaaa.

    - meeta, a part of the audience
