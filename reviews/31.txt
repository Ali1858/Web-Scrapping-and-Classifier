The very premise induces cringes in plenty – why are young men asked to treat all the young women around them as sisters? Sure, the issue of honor killing is touched upon, but it seems more as an after thought, when the writers realised that the premise is not virtuous enough to hold ground for an otherwise done-to-death “family vs. lovers” theme.

                        That no man really wants to treat women around him as sisters sounds more like a frustrated rant of a many-year-old, suppressed angst.
                    
There is a certain freshness in how the logistics of certain situations are explained. For example, the lies that need to be told to get one's way. In fact, these logistics implicitly point to how well characters know each other. For example, the stories a character makes up to get the parents to behave in a certain way. Both these aspects are rare in films and even more so because it is executed using the “show, don't tell” rule. There is some snappy dialogue to support this through too.
But this goodness lasts only a few scenes and is washed away with other sequences. In contrast, some scenes are just too superficial to make any sense. And a few others are replete with exaggeration.

None of the characters require any real out-of-the-world acting. The performers just need to not go overboard and that they manage – more or less. 
Given the one line plot of a love story that is as standard as it gets, it boiled down to the angle this particular premise takes on the plot. That no man really wants to treat women around him as sisters sounds more like a frustrated rant of a many-year-old, suppressed angst. Now, would that motivate you to watch the film?
