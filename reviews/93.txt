Kabali was always going to be 100% about Rajinikanth's super stardom. It was going to be about his action, his style, his persona. The character Kabali would be designed to suit that purpose. Unfortunately, it doesn't blend well at all with this attempt at “gang war with a heart”.

I shudder as I say that maybe a star vehicle like this is better off without a story rather than having botched attempts at drama and emotion under the garb of action. It makes just every thing seem forced - even the action, even the supposedly “cool” lines. 
In fact, even Kabali's catchphrase is outright lame. It all boils down to Rajinikanth's delivery to make it as stylish as he possibly could. And yet it doesn't work. Other than that then, he plays his suave best. One scene in which he is overwhelmed by emotion stands out giving you a glimpse of what the actor can do despite the star in him.



The rest of the film is only to serve the over-arching purpose called “Rajinikanth”. In that too, Radhika Apte tries to hold her ground. You can tell she is trying to blend into the genre but can't help herself every once in a while. The other members of the cast overdo everything with shrills. It becomes repetitive and annoying.
In its own way it is a boon that the focus is never too far away from Rajinikanth. At least the target audience is happy. Though I must say I heard a couple of them restless for the interval. The second half had enough emotional mumbo-jumbo for even me to hope that the next double-crossing was around the corner. 
I was looking forward to the audience hooting at Rajinikanth's swag to keep me smiling for 2.5 hours. But, that didn't quite happen after the first five minutes of his expectedly stylish entry. I wonder why.

*It is cosmic intervention that this movie is the 1212th one in the wogma database. Or maybe it is just the Rajini force.
