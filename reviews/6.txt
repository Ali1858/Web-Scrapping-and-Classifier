Bhoomi is exactly what you expect. An over-dramatic story of a father and daughter who want to avenge the rape of the daughter. Right from when the film looks at establishing the adorably, loving bond that Bhoomi (Aditi Rao Hydari) and her father (Sanjay Dutt) share, it seems over-the-top. It never lets go of that tone and thus comes across as trying too hard and failing.

                        Actors try their best to underplay the loud dramatics.
                    
The dialogue is extremely heavy-handed. Every line seems like it wants to make an impact. It is saved by decent delivery though. The entire cast lends its lines some credibility. But, the intention of the lines itself is to be loud and forceful. So, there is only so much the actors can do. Almost each one of them takes on a mode and sticks through it – that's just how the characters are written. Despite some great performers, the performances cater to the demand to be overbearing – overbearingly tearful, funny, sad, angry, disgusting and so on. 
The situations that make for the story are episodic and the over-arching story is unengaging. All its attempt to appeal to emotion seem hollow. This is despite being a topic that concerns and affects our day-to-day lives. It doesn't help that each of the situations is dragged on for a bit too long, especially the “drunken” scenes in the first few minutes. Unfortunately, the big reveal of the film is quite predictable.

Except for the effort of the actors, there isn't anything going for Bhoomi. There are a couple of well conceptualised scenes, especially the one in the climax. But, one it is a little too dramatic too and it is of course very little, very late.
