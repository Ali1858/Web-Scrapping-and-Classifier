No doubt there is something very charming about a story line that starts with different threads and merges into one coherent story by the end. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi kills that romanticized idea. It is indeed painful to write a review when you have only bad things to say about it. Except for the one quirky character Ajay Ghosh, Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi has nothing going for it. And this is despite having a cast that consists Kay Kay Menon and Ranvir Shorey!

They do try their best, but what can they do with the little their individual threads do to contribute to the film. Individually a couple of their scenes work really well, but that's about it. But even that much cannot be said about Manu Rishi and Neha Bhasin's thread unless you call a hearty laugh at the writers, for calling Shakti Kapoor 'innocent looking', entertainment. 
Yes, it gets that crass at times. At others it alternates between plain silly and boring. It's difficult for me to get angry or hate something that a small budget film with a new director has tried to do. Life ki toh lag gayi only made me indifferent towards, which as is said, is worse than evoking hatred.
