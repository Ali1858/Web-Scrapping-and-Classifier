You are really trying to solve the puzzle along with the characters. There are enough pieces laid out for you. You want to piece them together but you struggle to fit it together. And then puuufff! You do it. Then your job is to just lay back and see it unfold. Your involvement has disappeared. Now, how far your puuufff moment is away from that of the film's big reveal moment determines if the movie did it well or not. Unfortunately, for Raaz Reboot, you figure it out some time around interval and there is long lag between that and when you're told.

Other than the “why” horror films barely have anything new, right? The “how” is merely a matter of details like: 
- Where will blood-colored liquid spookily drip from?
- What is going to pop out from the wash basin? 
- When the lead lady looks up scared, what shape would the spirit have taken?  
- When will the priest be called in?  
- Which religion(s) will the priest belong to? Which religion will finally succeed?    
And the “why” is interesting only until you've figured it out. Raaz Reboot checks the above list and does a bit more. However, there are a few things that it does or avoids that make the first half engaging. Like the pieces of the puzzle itself – the marital disharmony, the secret, the couple's other relationships. Also, the film doesn't leave its protagonists alone. These are smart people who go seek help or at least try to, instead of braving it by themselves.  So, you don't have the usual horror film question, “why won't she just tell her best friend?”



Yet, there are way too many gaping questions about motivations like, “Now why would one behave this way if one knew that?” I am not even talking about the supernatural mumbo-jumbo.
Fortunately, the performances are above what we have come to expect from films in this genre from this production house. Now, Kriti Kharbanda and Gaurav Arora have a lot of chemistry-free, flat moments. But, individually, they do well to scare and be scared. I enjoyed Emraan Hashmi's performance too. He keeps you guessing to the best of his capabilities. That he is let down by the writing department is another story.
I was engaged more than I expected to be. I had inadvertently tight muscles till the culprit was obvious. But then again, I scare easily. If you want to be spooked but not too seriously, you could just skim through this one when there's nothing else on TV.
