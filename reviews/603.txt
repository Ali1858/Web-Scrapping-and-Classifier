Love can be fatal and thus ishhq, dangerous. So dangerous that it cannot be found nor avenged over 500 years and five reincarnations. As ridiculous as it sounds, I do think there could have been a poetic charm about love over many lives, but the way Dangerous Ishhq is done, it comes across more as a field day for the costume and jewelry designers of the film. The setting with common people having super-human powers in real life didn't quite get with the current day story.

Yes, we accept it in our Harry Potters and we accepted weapons that spit light and made sounds in our Ramayans and Mahabharats because the entire setting is such, that of fantasy. Here, we are given the mandatory alternate medicine therapist, a doctor who begins to believe and a cop who doesn't trust - as is seen in most Bhatt films that touch upon the supernatural theme - which just doesn't work. You cannot ask me to 'just believe', you have to make me believe - which just about never happens in reincarnation films - be it one reincarnation or five. 
Add to that a 'comeback' by an actor from the 90s. The consolation is Karishma Kapoor makes nostalgic by being her same old shrill self who alternates her shrieks with playing a painted, plastic doll. The rest of the cast don't do much to engage you either. 
That would have been a complaint worth elaborating on had there been a plot that involved you with the character's stories. All you can do is laugh at every time Sanjana (Karisma Kapoor) hallucinated about one of her past lives. 
Ultimately, it ends up being a show case for Karishma Kapoor in different types of costumes and jewelry. Other than that, I didn't see any other reason for making a film based on this theme.
