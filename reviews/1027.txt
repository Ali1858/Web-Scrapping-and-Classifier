EMI certainly touches upon a very relevant issue in the society today. And though it showcases the concerns in the cities, it is pertinent in the interiors of the country too. It is also hilarious at regular intervals. Especially Mohan Joshi's drunken scene. And what with Sanjay Dutt doing what we know him to do best - deliver dialogues in Mumbai-underworld fashion and time his lines perfectly. The other actors are barely bearable - with Malaika Arora's existence taking first place.

So, the general idea and some of the details are right. But the individual stories chosen, which started off interestingly, became too sappy for my taste. And the other actors are barely bearable. The set-up of the stories, the reasons why the various characters take their loans and how they are unable to repay them is quite interesting. A different aspect is touched upon in each story. The plan for the recovery process is cute too, but the actual act is childish. And the final resolutions are so tacky and hurried that all the set-up seems like a complete waste. 
Also, it came across as if the writers were confused on what the purpose of the story was â€“ was it to narrate how these four people went through the process of taking, defaulting and repaying their loans, or was it to showcase the transition of a person from the mafia? In trying to do both they had to deal with 5 plots which not only was too much taken on the plate but also lengthened the movie a bit much.
Cinema as a source of education is taken way too seriously and yet the subject has been presented over-simplistically. And these put together actually undo what is actually entertaining in bits and pieces.
