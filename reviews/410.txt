For films like Chennai Express, reviews are futile, I accept. Fans of the star/director/genre are going to watch the film come what may. The rest of us couldn't be bothered with reading a review, let alone watching it. Sympathies with the latter group if you have "loved" ones in the former group who drag you into the theater kicking and screaming. May your 142 minutes rest in peace, or not.

In that sense, Chennai Express delivers exactly what is expected -
- histrionics by Shah Rukh Khan;  
- beauty and gorgeousness by Deepika Padukone;  
- loads and loads of buffoonery;  
- bold, bright, solid colored costumes, art-work and props;  
- slapsticky dialogue that trots around self-importantly;  
- and some peppy song and dance.  
As complete as any Rohit Shetty film is. 
Well, sans Ajay Devgn. So, you don't have his cool personality to bring calm or at least a break from the over-the-top state of affairs. Even otherwise, Shah Rukh Khan's facial contortions (except for when he has this one romantic twinkle in his eyes) remind me of our origins as a race. Here, he is actually supposed to make you laugh with all the monkey business. Yet, despite all my apathy towards the tomfoolery, there was one scene that got me the goose bumps. Of course, it was too little too late.
It doesn't help that not only are the jokes as predictable as every other SMS joke, the self-referencing SRK one-liners are predictable too! For the rest of the dialogue you are left with emotional/philosophical lines sound like they were picked from a book of quotes. What could have been funny if it happened once, either repeats itself or goes on for too long to kill whatever little joy it started with.
You wonder then, whether or not you should complain about half the film being in Tamil. I have no clue if the heavy mockery of what the Tamilians wear, how they speak, what they eat, how they eat is offensive. But I didn't find it in good taste. The only one trying to add grace to everything else, is Deepika Padukone. Since, I don't know if her diction was right or not, I can only say she didn't look convincing. Maybe, because it was apparent that she was trying really hard.
Through her character, an attempt is made to send a message across to the men of the nation. But again, the setting is way too off the topic for most of the length of the film to suddenly become about a particular social issue. All you can do is thank Rohit Shetty for small mercies - for having at least tried to make the film about something, a little less random.
After this gratitude then, all you can do is come out feeling happy that it wasn't worse than you expected. And at least, the crowd around you, the people this film is made for had a good time.
