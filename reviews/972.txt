Let's get the obvious complaint out of the way. What's you Rashee? is long, super-long, super-duper long. No. Just "super-duper long" wouldn't be enough. It needed that build-up, it's that long! AND despite that, it's not an outright bad film, but it keeps it from being an "undoubtedly great" one. Oh, well…

Let' get the second-most obvious thing about the film. This time a sure positive one. PRIYANKA CHOPRA. I'm usually more than okay with people not agreeing with my opinion of a film/performance/etc. But, I will be really surprised if there are more than meager handfuls who won't like Priyanka Chopra in this film. I had enough guys going siggggh and gals going wow (including me) every time she was on screen. Her performance(s) were brilliant one charming character after another. 
The third-most…Gotchya! You didn't think I was giving you a list of top 12 things about What's your rashee?, were you? But if I were to do that I'd guarantee, each paragraph sounded and talked about different things. Which is not what the 12 Priyanka characters do here. Yes, almost each of the 12 characters is charming, and a couple of them are very different from the norm. But the rest follow a format. There's something they want their groom-to-be or not-to-be to know and each Priyanka's 10 minutes of screen-time revolves around that issue. And this is extremely interesting for the first few times and obviously tiring after that. And the two that are different are too exaggerated to be true. 
Which is pretty much true of the entire story-line too. But the basic premise has been forgiven since we are already there to watch the film, right? And despite that we are asked for more. We have to accept the dad's selfishness and the brother's foolishness, the silly pundit and weird uncle, the prop sister-in-law and the I'm-here-to-lengthen-the-film aunt. 
Ooops! I almost forgot Harman Baweja. I surprise myself when I want to say, I think this guy can do well. He needs a chance where he's not over-shadowed by his star co-star. But, this one is all about the woman, right? Wrong. 
My issue with these so-called women-oriented films is also that they are well "so-called". While each one of the characters is today's girl with a mind of her own, it looks superficial. Because, she's still out for the man's support in needing what she wants and each one's approach is convoluted. And if there was ever a "throw me around from one guy to the other, how do I care which man I want to get married to", this is the one. Wait for the climax to react to this comment. 
This is what the writer's thinking process looks like. 
"Yo! Priyanka Chopra is one helluva actor. She needs a film that revolves under her character." 
. 
. 
. 
"But, we don't know how to write women-centric stories. Damn! That too for someone with a star stature." 
. 
. 
. 
"Let's go through options that we can explore. 7 days of the week, naah - sounds ridiculous. 31 days of the month - way too many. So 365 days a year is out of the question….hmmm…"
. 
. 
 Research - research - research  (am I giving too much credit? Well, the same man made the supposedly extensively researched Jodhaa Akbar, didn't he? Anyway... 
.

"Hey, look here's this Gujrati novel Kimball Ravenswood by Madhu Rye. Yay! Jackpot And they made a TV series out of the same theme and it was pretty popular, remember? Mr. Yogi? "
. 
. 
. 
"Done, then! Since we've to get Priyanka to act real well, and she'll sell. The director can leave the rest of the cast to do their own thing, snort, fart, smile, whine, whatever. And he can focus on just the lady." 
. 
. 
. 
"Hey, wait! 12 girls one after the other without a break will become monotonous. Let's throw in a couple of side-stories. Which ones? Don't matter. Say a Don theme and an extra-marital affair theme. It'll just break the flow for a bit. Doesn't sound good? I said "Don't matter!!" It don't matter even if we don't give them a closure. You just watch…"
.

"What else? It's masala no? We need songs. How many? Of course 12! Can't have any less, what if any one of Bhavna, Hansa, Anjali, Chandrika, Sanjana, etc, etc, etc feel bad? Can't risk that!" 
And so we have what we have. An extremely mediocre product if it were not for Ms. Piggy Chops. True, the songs are nice, very well-picturized and different too. But after the 3rd one it gets a little blah! And when there are so many, songs with lip-sync involved they sound repetitious too. 
Gone are the days Mr. Gowariker when the Hindi film audience thought found their money's worth only if the film touched the 180-minute mark. Rest assured we, the audience, won't think any less of you if your movie doesn't move the average run-time of films around the world by a notch. 
Yet, it's not boring. So, viewers will be better equipped to handle its length at home with the luxury of the "fast forward" switch at their disposal for the non-Priyanka parts, of course. Oh yeah and the opening credits are one of the best I've seen in Hindi films!
