Ghost versus host story. yawn 
Most ridiculous product placement, including those krrish 3.   
Awful and misplaced jokes on a couple of people from the film fraternity.   
Absolutely gratuitous skin show and sexual content.   
Shrieking.

Done-to-death typical background score.

Yes, you guessed right. Ragini MMS 2 is like any other B-grade horror film or Horrex (Horror-Sex for the uninclined) as Ragini MMS 2 likes to call itself. Do not be surprised if I copy-paste this review for the next similarly done film in the genre.
Or maybe i should have such a ready review of this nature for each genre. Now, that's a thought.
