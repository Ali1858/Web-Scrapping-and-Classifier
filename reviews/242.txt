Sure, I knew what the movie is going to be about. Not being a huge fan of Basu Chatterjee's film either, didn't help. But, that The Shaukeens would have no redeeming factor whatsoever, was disappointing.

I don't consider myself a prude or conservative, but watching the likes of Anupam Kher, Annu Kapoor and Piyush Mishra as lechers isn't my idea of fun. It doesn't help that Lisa Haydon seems to be playing dumb, but looks too smart to be playing so dumb. 
That's not to say, that they don't act well. At least the men. They do their jobs well enough to creep out any woman in their vicinity - both on screen and in the audience.
I don't really have much more to say about this one except that I had to keep comparisons with my all-time worst film ever, *Buddha Mar Gaya * at bay. And it wasn't the easiest task to do that.
