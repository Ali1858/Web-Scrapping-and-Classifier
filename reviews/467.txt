Except for the first few times that Neil Nitin Mukesh emotes fear, 3G has nothing going for it. The minimal good effects of that too are erased off, for what his character is made to do later in the film.

From the basis of the scary supernatural to the ludicrous technical and metaphysical mumbo-jumbo, everything about 3G first makes you slap your palm to your forehead, then irritates and finally bores you with repetitions. There might be just a couple of occasions where you might look forward to something novel, but that dies down almost immediately.
Just when you think the pace couldn't get any slower, you are thrown into a song with pretty much no rhyme or reason other than some gratuitous skin show. 
If at all the film managed to hook you for a bit, the question would haunt, "Why aren't they leaving Fiji? The exotic location songs are done already?" 
You get the drift, so let's keep this short. There must be better themes for horror lovers to make horror, no?
