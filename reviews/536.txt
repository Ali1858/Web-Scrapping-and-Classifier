As expected, Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal is everything we thought it would be â€“ loud, ridiculously incoherent and annoyingly induces sleep. Yep, I strongly resisted my urge to nod off while waiting for the interval. I guess it was too loud to let me doze off.
It is such a shame to watch Paresh Rawal repeat himself endlessly and try to put his heart into it. It is so frustrating to watch Om Puri be at his loudest best. It is so disappointing to see Nana Patekar come back after such a long time and have nothing to do with his character except play emotionless, which of course he does well. And it is extremely upsetting to see Shreyas Talpade reduced to shouting in the name of acting.

I am not even going to venture into talking about the plot and how it doesn't make sense, about the character transformations, etc. Any effort I put in seems like it would be more than what the writers could be bothered with. The minutest interest is triggered with how good-for-nothing and shameless Johnny (Shreyas Talpade) is. But that too wears off. How long can you hold on to yelling after all? 
What I am left with after the film is this ordeal of course of having to review it. But also with this thought. It's easy to pass a verdict and say that such films shouldn't be made. But, what if this is the only thing that keeps these actors in the game? And the trade-off is that it also keeps these directors/writers in too. Tough call.
