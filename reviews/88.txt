In their childhood, boy sees girl and girl sees boy. Love at first sight happens. They part as soon as they meet. Years later guess what happens? How is this even a story? How is the story of this character legendary? I very consciously try not to say this about any film, but I am so close to asking - why is “The Legend of Michael Mishra” even a movie?
Love stories in which the protagonists go to extremes to prove their love are common enough. Love stories in which the hero thinks he is going to an extreme when he isn't really, can only get your eyes to roll. Top it off with lame dialogue and average performances and there is barely anything to appreciate about it. 
The Legend of Michael Mishra has no substance what so ever, which is alright, right? We are used to films with no substance. Well, this one has no form either.
