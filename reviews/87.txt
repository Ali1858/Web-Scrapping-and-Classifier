“What happened” might be one of the most consuming question in a thriller. Then maybe, “how and why”. But, all is lost when the narrator messes up the “how the audience finds out.” This is where Rustom loses out in a thriller that otherwise might just have worked out.

One of the biggest cop-outs is when the perpetrator tells how he did it to another character, rather than the story-teller showing us how it happened. Even the best of reveals comes across as too easy or too lame or both when that happens. Rustom not only does that, but also has two parallel threads running that don't connect completely in the end. 
I love a well-done court-room drama, but Rustom doesn't quite make it engaging. There are loopholes and convenient coincidences. In its attempt to keep things light, it makes caricatures out of the prosecutor, the judge and the owner of a newspaper. 



The main characters all have to wear one expression through the film. Akshay Kumar, the accused, is stern (garbed as restrained?). Ileana D'cruz, the accused's cheating wife is sorry. Arjan Bajwa, the supposed villain smirks and his sister, Esha Gupta, the supposed vamp, smirks more. That is more or less what they do. 
They are all styled like they are in the 50s-60s. Whether or not it is authentic, it sure is refreshing. At times even distracting from the story. The story by itself works, the back and forth in time-line notwithstanding. But, it all comes crumbling down in the end. 
It's a safe bet to say that a thriller that goes wrong with its climax is likely to fail as a thriller. If it were not for that, Rustom might just have worked, despite its disengaging performances.
