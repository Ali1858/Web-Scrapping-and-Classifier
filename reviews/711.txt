I'm a little under the weather. The annoying type of being unwell where you don't have fever but are feverish. While walking into Hum Tum Shabana I thought all ache-able parts of my body are already aching. Nope. Hum Tum Shabana made me realize that my ears weren't aching at the beginning.

Hum (Shreyas Talpade/Tusshar Kapoor), Tum (Tusshar Kapoor/Shreyas Talpade) and Shabana (Minissha Lamba) are all loud and are surrounded by louder people. The story goes from weird (two guys falling in love at the same time with the same woman the first time they see her on screen) to berserk (wooing her in the most ridiculous fashion) to utter rubbish (they want to get out of proposing to her because of reasons you should find out for yourself, if you are interested despite this warning). Sometime in the berserk era, there is one scene that is so ridiculous that it's funny. "How could you even come up with that?" kind of funny. 
But save that there's nothing at all in the film. Well, I guess I got that  one laugh I was looking for. 
These are times I wish I could borrow, NW1W (not worth one word) concept from milliblog. Till then, here's my attempt at keeping it short and simple - Skip!
