You are not expecting intelligent cinema when you walk into a Sajid Khan film. That is a no-brainer. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised as I saw some semblance of a story in the first hour. It made way too much sense (even if in a slapsticky kind of way) for a film that was made by the same person who made Housefull 2. It is insensitive at multiple levels, yet it is borderline "not as bad as I thought". And then of course, it goes into one bad sub-plot after another till you are sick and tired of it all.

Why did Saif Ali Khan do this one? Is the money that good? Or for that matter Bipasha Basu. Her role is so tiny and most of the time that she's on screen she is relegated to second lead lady. Ram Kapoor is the best of the lot, but that's barely a compliment. Sure, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh do try to contort their faces in ways which made the theater laugh, but that seemed like child's play. Anyway, a change of genre for Riteish Deshmukh is long overdue, I'll hold off comment till Ek Villain. In this one though he does his usual stuff. When the lines are unengaging there is only so much you can do. 
Interestingly, you'd have thought that the film would rely heavily on one-liners and punch lines to get a laugh out of its audiences. But instead, the "comedy" came from the situations rather than a dialogue here or there. I must confess here, that this is my judgment from the way the viewers were reacting rather than my own response. 



My gut wrenched as the insults got heavier and heavier. I'm not talking about the assault on my intellect. But, about the insensitivity shown towards patients of mental asylums; towards gay people; towards obese people; towards midgets; towards men who dress like women and so on. What is it about these things that makes us laugh? Why is it funny? A mental hospital warden (not even a doctor!) dancing with electrical wires while giving an electrical shock to his patients! Really? That's not humor, that's sad. 
I understand, that not every thing needs to turn into an outrage and we should know how to laugh at ourselves and so on. And to complete the circle, Sajid Khan cracks a joke at his own film too. But I am not comfortable with poking fun at people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching it is not done. 
I guess I should only be thankful that the film keeps sexual and toilet humor under control. Though there are long scenes involving each one of them which made me cringe. 
I am not really expecting to enjoy a Sajid Khan film any time soon. But, is a little sensitivity too much to ask for from a filmmaker who has a reasonably wide reach? Does humor have to be at someone else's expense?
