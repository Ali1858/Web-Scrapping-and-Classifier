Three young friends rob houses. Maybe for the thrill, maybe they need the money. Maybe both. But the fun and thrill are sucked out of their endeavours when they try to rob a blind man. Now, here comes the twist. You would think you want the trio to pay for their crimes and root for the poor ol' blind man. But, very soon,  you find yourself praying for the youngsters. And this is just from the trailer. As discomforting as it is, I liked this turn of emotions that the writers/director manage. Other than that though, Don't Breathe gave me the same old, “Why make horror films at all?!” feeling.

As you walk out of the theater you realise that your muscles are tight not because of the suspense from the last 90 minutes. But it is from the shock value of what a human mind gone wrong is capable of. Don't Breathe could just have been another CSI episode – granted, one of the more creepier ones. 
Of course, a movie can manage to send a chill down your spine only if it well-made. This means, the direction is taut and the performances are on the mark. True to expectations, the characters are all appropriately scared and trying to outsmart each other, knowing quite well that they might fail. 



The camerawork manages to maintain the suspense. Especially, when it goes down to minimum light possible in an already dark environment. You and the other characters get as close a feel as is possible, to what the blind man must go through to find his way around. 
Even so, nothing makes me like films in this genre. Even if the shock tactics worked to keep the four couples around us quiet from their constant nervous giggling and chatter. I can just about make myself acknowledge that it scared me, so it must be good. However, scaring me doesn't take much, so...
