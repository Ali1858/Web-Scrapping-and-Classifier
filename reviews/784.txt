Some of the concepts that form Luv ka the end are sick. It's not that I don't believe that betting to woo a girl or similar stuff doesn't exist. But it forms the main theme of the film and this is passed off as entertainment for the youth and "girl power". That thought is disturbing.

Ria, as the movie claims, is a simple, sweet virgin. She is in love with Luv (I can't make this stuff up!). And he loves her too. Hah! Gotchya! No, she is just a means to a devious end for him. When she finds out she does exactly what any girl with any dignity should do. And they enjoy every bit of it. Fair enough. But why does it have to be full of only run-of-the-mill toilet and sexual humor? 
The only saving grace is the charming presence of Shraddha Kapoor
I've always enjoyed campus stories. When I was younger I could identify with them and now they make me nostalgic. But, this is weird and worrisome. And it hardly a condolence that it's not "Love" spelt wrong in the title.
