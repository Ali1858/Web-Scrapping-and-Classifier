Would I be saying anything new at all when I say, the book is better – in the way it unfolds and in the nuances you know about the character.

It doesn't take the usual path of a thriller suspense. It starts of with you wondering about the protagonist as she mulls in a train and talks about her obsession with the people who live by the track. And it slowly builds up about specific people who live by the track and so on. 
You are slowly introduced to two other women and the live they lead. But you don't get to know them too well – what do they think or like. They seem sort-of coincidental to the film. I would have liked to know them better. It is a good thing though that the characters are well-cast.

Emily Blunt (Rachel), Haley Bennett (Megan) and Rebecca Ferguson (Anna) do well with the sketchy character sketches drawn for them. However, it felt like the camera did a lot of their work for them.

Unfortunately, though the story doesn't take that further. It becomes an episodic narration of one thing after another with a bit of back and forth in the timeline. It might leave you a little disoriented but never disinterested. If only the big reveal came a little smoothly. 



If you haven't guessed already, yes – almost each of those sentences above could end with “unlike in the book”. Even if the book isn't the greatest read there is.
