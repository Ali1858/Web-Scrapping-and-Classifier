Ragini MMS is the same old spooky Hindi, supernatural film. In fact, the first half an hour or so of the film is like you are watching a sleazy, slow B-grade film with crass language and an attempt at overt "sexual" scenes. The only thing that stands the film apart from the rest of the films that fall in this bracket is the awesome performances.

The one thing that completely cheeses me off is that these "horror" films have no real story. They titillate and are repititive. They don't really need a set up because even if you hate the character you don't want such bad things to happen to him. If he's that bad you want the punishment under your control maybe and not some mean and grumpy, old ghost. 
That's where the film succeeds. Uday Jhalla is a lousy, cheesy, creepy character and you want him to get away from the spirit. Raj Kumar Yadav squeezes every bit of aversion and later pity out of you. Kainaz Motivala too evokes sympathy through her naivet√© and helplessness. 
Despite the bleh first half, some of the spook-inducing decisions made in the second half were freaking awesome. The kind where even 95 minutes seem too long. In this duration it's not because Ragini MMS is a bad film but because you want that claustrophobia to go away. The director has done something right if every time the spirit speaks, my skin crawls. (Or could it be because it kept reminding me of Nandita Das' performance in Chitra Palekar's Marathi film, maati maay"?)
You have to be a horror film lover to enjoy this one. Nope, there is no real titillation in terms of the sexual scenes indicated in the promos.
Oh yeah, and here is my standard horror-film disclaimer. Basically, I can't handle them.
