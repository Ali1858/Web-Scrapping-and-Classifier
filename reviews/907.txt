Did you know it’s a big bad world out there? Did you know our country is rotting because of the corruption and bureaucracy prevalent because of the rogue nexus between the politicians, police and the corporate world? Did you know that we are the ones who brought many of these people the power to take us for granted this way? Did you know the entire system takes away our innocence? 
Damn! You knew all of that?! Smart you… Ok, I got more…

Did you know that all of this can be compressed into two hours?  Did you know a fresh-on-the-block idealistic journalist can give you a 2 minute spiel and turn you into an activist? Did you know this journo can act so bad that she can put some of the best ramp-walkers-turned-into-actors a run for their money (AND she looks like she has never walked the ramp either or rather she better not have)? Did you know that she had competition in the ‘bad acting’ department from almost the entire rest of the cast? Did you know that the film actually had a couple of interesting ironies that I’m willing to bet were not intended by the makers? 
Did you know that I know that you are now tired of these questions you know the answers to? Did you know that it’s taking all the will power I can will out of myself to spend any more time and energy (forget the 23,000 paise I spent) on the movie by writing about it? Did you know I have given up on will power? 
Well, now you do…
