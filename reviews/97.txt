The teaser was enough to bring an eerie discomfort you would associate with a well-made horror film. Unfortunately for the film and fortunately for the viewers you get comfortable with the discomfort.

If it were not for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's spine-chilling performance, Raman Raghav 2.0 wouldn't have had much of an impact. The story by itself barely has any material beyond its one-line plot. The big reveal would either be predicted by seasoned movie-goers or will seem too contrived when it comes about for those who didn't guess it before hand. 
Either way, it holds no charm or shock despite the fact that the concept by itself is thought provoking. The “psycho” element in this psycho-thriller comes a little too late, even if it is not too little. 



The rest of the film has no movement, neither is the slow pace arresting. Each sequence functions as an additional proof of how brutal Raman (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is. It is nerve-wrecking. It is scary. But it goes on for tad too long. Even so, for fans of the actor, the director or the genre, there is enough to keep you in your seats. You might or might not remember much after you leave it though.
