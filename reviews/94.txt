You expect kids to be entertained in an  animation film made for kids and that purpose is served. However, in terms of novelty Ice Age has nothing – visually or in the story.

The first thing that comes to mind when I think “Ice Age” is Ray Romano's voice. By itself the voice has a quality that is entertaining. However, too much of any thing borders unbearable. In Ice Age Collision Course, the voice sounds more like an annoying drawl. 
The rest of the characters are asked to shriek and shrill they are. Every character is excited and therefore every voice sounds urgent, in panic or just out of control. A lot like a slapstick film. Even though, thankfully, Ice Age Collision Course is not too slapsticky, it is a good thing that the loud circus lasts for only about 95 minutes.



Ice Age Collision Course could have pretty much done without 3D - except for the “acorn causing havoc” phases of the film, maybe. The film doesn't even try to use the technology creatively. 
Just like it doesn't even try to write a new plot. A bunch of animals are trying to escape some geological phenomenon. Because cuteness coefficient of animals > human, family values and emotions we associate with humans are enacted by animals. That too with lazy and lame writing. There are a few smiles but they are few and far between. 
Ice Age Collision Course has just about enough to engage its target audience – kids who have followed the franchise. After all, they get their dose of pop corn and soda along with it.
